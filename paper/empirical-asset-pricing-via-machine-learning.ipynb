    "# Gu et al, Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "__1.1 Contribution__: \n",
    "1. Provide benchmarks for predictive accuracy of expected returns (OOS $R^2$ and SR)\n",
    "2. Synthesize empirical asset pricing with ML. ML allows for more expressive functional form and higher dimensionality of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "__1.2 Motivation__: To better forecast conditional expected stock returns (risk premia).\n",
    "1. Features: high dimensionality + high correlation\n",
    "2. Functional Forms: nonlinearities, interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Methodology\n",
    "- Statistical Model\n",
    "- Objective Function (MSE)\n",
    "- Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "__2.1 Formulation__:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{i,t+1}=\\mathbb{E}\\left[r_{i,t+1}|\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right]+\\epsilon_{i,t+1}$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[r_{i,t+1}|\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right] = g^{*}\\left(z_{i,t}\\right)$$\n",
    "Stocks are indexed by $i=1,...,N_t$ (each month has different number of stocks); and months are indexed by $t=1,...,T$\n",
    "\n",
    "__2.2 Statistical Models__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _OLS_\n",
    "  - Extension: OLS with Huber Loss\n",
    "2. _Penalized Linear_ (Elastic Net)\n",
    "3. _Dimensionality Reduction_: PCR and PLS<br>\n",
    "  - Predictor averaging vs. Predictor selection (as in penalized linear)<br>\n",
    "  - Predictor selection: Penalized linear produces suboptimal forecasts when predictors are highly correlated.<br>\n",
    "  - Predictor averaging: dimensionality reduction\n",
    "      - PCR: PCA + OLS (fails to include forecasting object in the PCA step)\n",
    "      - PLS: Reduce dimension by expoiting covariation of predictors with the target\n",

    "5. _RF and GBM_\n",

    "$$R_{OOS}^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{\\left(i,t\\right)\\in \\mathcal{T}_3} \\left(r_{i,t+1}-\\hat{r}_{i,t+1}\\right)^2}{\\sum_{\\left(i,t\\right)\\in \\mathcal{T}_3} r_{i,t+1}^2}$$\n",

    "$\\hat{e}_{i,t+1}^{\\left(1\\right)}$ and $\\hat{e}_{i,t+1}^{\\left(2\\right)}$ denote the prediction error for stock return $i$ at time $t$ from model 1 and model 2; <br>\n",

    "   We include stocks with price below $5$ dollars, share codes beyond 10 and 11, and financial firms. <br>\n",
    "   __Three Reasons__: <br>\n",
    "     - Commonly used filters remove certain stocks that are S&P500 components, and find it problematic;\n",
    "     - Less prone to sample selection and data snooping biases;\n",
    "     - Results are qualitatively identical and quantitatively unchanged if we filter out those firms\n",

    "     - __Cross-sectional Ranking__: rank all stock characteristics period-by-period and map these ranks into $\\left[-1,1\\right]$ interval;\n",
    "     - __Missing Values__: replace with the cross-sectional median at each month for each stock\n"
